# NumericalAlgos
this repo will contain my implementation of various numerical
algorithms in lua and c.

Particularly, this repo will contain my implementations of
code from the books by Sastry and Burden.Additionally,
I will create parallelized versions of the sequential
algorithms using the multithreaded libraries: MPI and OPenMP;

There will be 3 main folders called Sastry,Burden, MPIOMP
