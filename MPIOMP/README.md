 * Sorting
 * Fast Fourier Transform
 * Combinatorial Search
 * Shared-Memory Programming
 * Appendix A: MPI Functions
 * Appendix B: Utility Functions
 * Appendix C: Debugging MPI Programs
 * Appendix D: Review of Complex Numbers
 * Appendix E: OPenMP Functions

Each Chapter will have a directory dedicated to it.
